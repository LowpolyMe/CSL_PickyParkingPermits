# Picky Parking

Work-in-progress mod that adds parking lot rules in Cities: Skylines 1. The goal is to let you control who is allowed to use a parking lot, with simple per-building rules and radius checks.

Current focus:
- Residents, work/school, and visitors as separate rule types.
- Per-building rules with radius sliders.
- Small overlay preview for the radius.
- Rules saved with the city.
