# Picky Parking
Work-in-progress mod that adds parking lot restrictions in Cities: Skylines 1

---

If you've ever parked a car in Germany, you know this: **parking here is a character test**.

We have: Residents-only parking, visitor parking, provided sparingly and subject to restrictions, and entire neighborhoods where parking is less about finding a free spot and more about being allowed to park there. It's bureaucratic, it's infuriating, and it's German to the core. 
In Cities Skylines, there is no concept of local parking restrictions, and as a German, I found this deeply unsettling.

**Picky Parking fixes that disturbing lack of Ordnung.**

This mod allows you to define who may park on specific parking lots and under which local conditions. You can **restrict parking** to residents, to nearby workers or students, allow or deny visitors, and decide exactly which parking lots apply these rules. Everything is explicit, specific and uncompromisingly strict. Just like parking in Germany.
